            <h3>Normal People by Sally Rooney</h3>

            <p>Genre: Contemporary, Adult Literary Fiction</p>
            <p>
                While it is a Man booker prize long list nominee and is a book that has many admirers, sadly it didn't work for me. <br>
                Why? Why do I do this to myself? Sighâ€¦ I get it. This novel is very popular and much loved. <br> While I recognize that Rooney has talent, I did not vibe with Normal People! <br>
                There are characters who dislike themselves, shrug a lot, and say "I don't know" 24/7, which are very deep and realistic while being impossible! I felt the whole character's connection was reduced to sex!

            <h3>More Bodies Will Fall by Ankush Saikia</h3>

            <p>
                I am always in the mood for thrillers and so, was intrigued by the premise of this novel. <br>
                The backdrop is set in northeast India was just the cherry on the top! Every time I read a book set in India, I learn so much about the rich - both good and bad - history of our country and I am in awe of how much we don't know about our own country! The plot is quite multi-layered and everything and everyone is a suspect! <br/>
                The mystery in itself is very well thought out - not easy to predict and gradually, all loose ends are tied up.

            <h3>The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry, Richard Howard (Translator)</h3>

            <p>Genre: Childrenâ€™s Classic</p>
            <p>
                This book pleased my inner child! It made me realize that the right books find you when you need them the most! This was an intensely lyrical and mesmerizing book written by an ailing middle-aged adult in the middle of war-torn years. <br>
                It makes you confront emotions of hurt and pain all hidden in a simple children's story (exactly like an elephant was hidden inside a boa constrictor). <br>
                That first chapter of the kid & the drawing was so gut-wrenching to read as an adult that, I wished to go inside the story and protect the kid with all my might!
