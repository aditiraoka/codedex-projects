            <h2 class="book-title">The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo by Taylor Jenkins Reid</h2>
            <p class="book-genre"><i> Genre: Fiction, Romance, Mystry </i></p>
             <img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b899fb_eb267c307f5a417c8d623e7c21092af0~mv2.png" alt="A photo of paperback of SHoEH" id="book-img"/>
            
            <p class="review-content">
                <br><br>This is one of the most hyped books on social media and my first 5-star read. Taylor Jenkins Reid strikes again. I picked this book up as a January pick for a book club (@theauthorisedbookclub) and that was the best book, to begin with!
                <br><br>Honestly, I think she laces the pages of her books with magic! I could not put this book down at all. The mystery around our protagonist & her cryptic statements kept me hooked!
                <br><br>The Plot: Evelyn Hugo was no ordinary star. She dominated the big screen for more than four decades. Although she was a great actress, she was infamous for her seven husbands. Evelyn Hugo was married seven times and each divorce only increased her fame.
                <br><br>After being out of the spotlight for some time, Evelyn Hugo, age 79, decided to auction off her most famous gowns for charity and offers to interview, which is a huge deal. A small-scale journalist Monique who is prepared for a fluff piece, soon learns that this is beyond a two-page spread. Evelyn Hugo is offering a tell-all - a full biography - that promises to be the most scandalous and salacious thing that has ever graced this world.
                <br><br>Amidst her internal chaos, Monique is confused as to why she was picked and is told that she will learn soon about it. Monique would be a fool to pass this up. But the thought, the 'it's too good to be true' sort of thought, continues to replay in her mind.
                <br><br>The more she learns about Evelyn, the more she admires and tries to embody her. But will she still agree to write her story once she learns the entire truth?
                <br><br> <b>My Rating: 5/5</b>

            <h2 class="book-title">Karma A Yogi‚Äôs guide to crafting your destiny by Sadguru</h2>
            <p class="book-genre"> <i> Genre: Spiritual, Non-fiction </i></p>
            <img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b899fb_992b5a1cbb654ccd9d5f46f6f9bbd97f~mv2.png" alt="A photo of paperback of Karma" id="book-img"/>
            <p class="review-content">
                <i>‚ÄúIt is just that for every action, there is a consequence‚Äù</i>
                <br><br>Who hasn‚Äôt heard the phrase ‚ÄúKarma‚Äôs a bitch‚Äù or ‚ÄúKarma will bite you back‚Äù. After reading this, you will realize that Karma is probably the most widely misused/misinterpreted word.
                <br><br>This book, my god, is so beautifully written that I could write pages about how I felt while reading this (don‚Äôt worry I won‚Äôt). It explains one of the most complex aspects of spirituality in such layman's terms all the while avoiding mixing it up with religious practices.
                <br><br> I understand one can‚Äôt completely forgo the mention of religion while talking about spirituality but Sadhguru writes about religion or its practices without imposing on the reader as the ultimate way to be spiritual.
                <br><br>This book is divided into 3 parts. First, it explains what Karma is and how it affects us. Second, how can one burn their allocated Karma? Third, Karma conversations, where Sadhguru answers some questions he is asked on this topic.
                <br><br>There are so many beautiful quotes/sutras but one stuck with me the most: It is the context, not the content of your life, that determines karmic accumulation.
                <br><br>And unlike this book, most spiritual books I read, talk about Vedas and Upanishads and other holy scripture - which is great and I love it. But fail to help me understand how to imply that in today‚Äôs modern world.
                <br><br>That's why I loved this book. Sadhguru explains all things spiritual in such modern terms. Be it comparing one‚Äôs life to software or giving examples of how to burn bad & earn good karma in today‚Äôs world.
                <br><br> My Ratings: 5/5
                <br><br>Although it may need some effort to understand the complex (Sanskrit) words, I definitely recommend this book to everyone, regardless of the belief system.

            <p class="book-genre"><i> Genre: Romance, New Adult </i></p>

            <p class="review-content">
                <i> hy¬∑poth¬∑e¬∑sis (noun): A supposition or proposed explanation made on the basis of limited evidence, as a starting point for further investigation. </i>
                <br><br>
                Hypothesis 1: I am a sucker for hate-to-love, fake dating, women in STEM kind of Romance books.
                <br><br> I think I found my new comfort read!! <a href="">@alihazelwood</a> stole my heart and soul with this debut novel. I rarely love rom-com coz I try to find logic in them and of course, it doesn‚Äôt usually have one (that‚Äôs what makes it a rom-com right?).
                <br><br> But this book was so well written that I forgot to find logic in this! I just fell in love (pun intended) with this book!
                <br><br> I have told you before and I will tell again, there is just something about male characters written by female authors that makes them just about perfect! And Dr. Adam Carlsen is one perfect fictional man I have ever read! Ali Hazelwood just gave us the perfect book boyfriend y‚Äôall!
                <br><br> As a female in the STEM field (Engineering) myself, I absolutely was smitten by this book.
                <br><br> It‚Äôs been more than a couple of weeks and like Olive, I am still dreaming about Dr. Carlsen!
                <br><br> Romance aside, the author has discussed some real issues, like misogyny and other problems women in STEM face, quite well.
                <br><br> It is sad how much of a reality it is. But kudos to Ali Hazelwood for writing it so well.
                <br><br> I really loved the grumpy/sunshine combo, the nerdish, sexy, entertaining banters, the way he calls her smart ass (I think it is mandatory for a hot guy to have some lame nickname for the main character).
                <br><br> Would I recommend it? Hell yeah! Easy read, some amazing chemistry, hate the world but you kind of nerdish heroes and their gibberish scientific sweet talks ‚Äì what else do you want? 
                <br><br> If you read it, let me know what you thought of it.
                <br><br> Conclusion to Hypothesis 1: True Positive
                <br><br> <b>My Rating: 5/5</b>
                <br><br> Expect more posts about this book coz I'm not done yelling about it üôàüò¨

            <h2 class="book-title">The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides</h2>
            <p class="book-genre"><i> Genre: Psychological Thriller, Mystery, Fiction </i></p>
             <img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b899fb_f7952ee658a14d2ab0f2342a0880d547~mv2.png" alt="A photo of paperback of Silent Patient" id="book-img"/>
            
            <p class="review-content">
                <br><br> Silence tells a thousand tales. This statement seems true for Alex Michaelides's latest psychological thriller - The Silent Patient. It is one of those books which messes with your mind as you try to figure out what is going on with the characters.
                <br><br> I have made so many annotations and written quite a few notes in the margins trying to work out the story.
                <br><br> If you are a sucker for answers like me, then you will not rest until you have finished this book. For a debut novel, this is one hell of a book!
                <br><br> My Rating: 5/5
                <br><br> My Thoughts: I learned quite a few things from this book. The way Theo is shown ‚Äì flaws and all ‚Äì makes one realize that therapists are people as well.
                <br><br> Like Theo, I was mostly drawn to this book due to Alicia‚Äôs story. How do you not speak to defend yourself? How does one go silent in face of such a trauma-inducing incident? I wanted answers. I needed answers. And boy oh boy did I get it!
                <br><br> As Theo unravels Alicia‚Äôs life, you start to understand what might have driven her to act the way she might have acted. Until the end, you are left guessing if the crime was committed by Alicia or someone unknown to the public due to her silence.
                <br><br> The ending was an unexpected twist in the story! And a huge one in that. I thought the killer almost got away with their crimes (yes multiple) but the ending concluded in such a satisfying way. I was yelling at the characters and making furious notes in the margins.
                <br><br>  I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about this for a couple of days after finishing the book. If you can bear with a couple of the dark and twisted parts, this is surely a must-read suggestion from my end.
                <br><br> In short, this was one engaging, nail-biting, unputdownable thriller. I would recommend reading this book.

            <p class="review-content">
                <br><br>Infosys chairperson, engineer, author, social worker ‚Äì Mrs Sudha Murty is quite famous for her work with Infosys Foundation and its philanthropic projects. Her talks and works have always fascinated me. I have had the pleasure to attend a couple of her talks and her simplicity amazes me. Draped in a simple cotton saree, she talks in such a sweet manner that puts the entire audience at ease.
                <br><br>This book is a tad bit different from her other books that I have read. It is a collection of 11 stories that convey her experience with the Infosys foundation. Each story has a nice heartwarming ending while teaching a couple of morals at each turn. The stories range from charity work to personal experiences with family and friends.
                <br><br>The stories follow her journey from childhood to her current position at the Infosys foundation. She emphasizes believing in yourself and chasing your dream no matter what obstacles you may face.
                <br><br> This book took me on a trip down my memory lane. At my school, we had an hour-long Moral Science class every Saturday! Each week we were taught a new story with a Moral/teaching moment in the end. I have always cherished those classes and this was a nice reminder of those days.
                <br><br>The one thing that I found astonishing is her ability to retain her childhood memories so vividly! This is something I envy :p If I had to pick one story that stuck with me, it would be How to beat the boys. Trust me when I say the title is misleading. :D It conveys the message: if you want something, you need to give it your everything, no matter the obstacles.
                <br><br> <b>My Rating: 4/5 </b>
                <br><br>My thoughts: This was a nice, feel-good kind of read. In an attempt to read more Indian authors, I bought this book. It is safe to say it was a good buy. As this is a collection of short stories, you can pick it up at any time.

            <h2 class="book-title">Atomic Habits by James Clear</h2>
            <p class="book-genre"><i> Genre: Non-fiction, Self-help </i></p>
             <img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b899fb_1cb8d4aeb9b84a739aa17f926f24d208~mv2.png" alt="A photo of paperback of Atomic Habits" id="book-img"/>
            
            <p class="review-content">
                <br><br> This book is not your run-of-the-mill generic self-help book. Trust me I have read my fair share of them.
                <br><br> One major reason that I initially picked up this book was that I saw Jack Edwards talk about it highly in a video.
                <br><br> I honestly thought that this book was just going to be a bunch of previously read feel-good, you can do it, pep talk. However, it had an entire list of actionable steps you can take to help you make progress on your goals.
                <br><br> My Rating: 4/5
                <br><br> My Thoughts: This book was divided into six parts: intro, 4 laws, and advanced tactics. To create a good habit, author James Clear suggests: Make it Obvious, Make it Attractive, Make it Easy, Make it Satisfying.
                <br><br> One thing I loved about this book is that it not only tells you how to form a new ‚Äògood‚Äô habit, but it also gives you how to break bad ones.
                <br><br> Also, the content is easily understandable.
                <br><br> James‚Äô personal story is very impressive as well.
                <br><br> Different parts are likely to resonate with different readers but I found a lot of helpful information in this book, especially in one of the final chapters about how to stay motivated ‚Äî Mastery requires practice.
                <br><br> I enjoyed this book and I feel Atomic Habits is a read I recommend for anyone trying to step up their game, with the reminder that refinement and improvement are continuous, long-term processes.
